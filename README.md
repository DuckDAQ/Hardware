# DuckDAQ Hardware
The goal of this project was to build a low-cost DAQ (Data Acquisition device) by using modern integrated circuits. DuckDAQ is controlled and powered over a USB bus by a personal computer. DuckDAQ is based on Atmel's MCU.

It has **4 fully differential analog inputs** with 12-bit resolution and input range between -10V and 10V. It can achieve of up to 100 thousand samples per second.

DAQ also has **2 analog outputs** with a 12-bit resolution with a voltage range from -10V to 10V.

The hardware was designed in Altium Designer.
